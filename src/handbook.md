# RPN 15C User's Handbook

A visual TUI mimicry of classic HP 15C pocket calculator. Just as
the appearance is only similar, so to is the operation only similar.

All operations are based on reverse polish notation or RPN where an
operation is performed on data previosly entered into a stack of values.

In this handbook the square brackets around an identifier denote a button.

# Operations

## Unary Operations

The simplest operation are unary, that is they perform an action of a
single value. An example of a unary operation is setting the display
precision which defaults to four digits after the decimal. To change it
to three digits type [3] then the [f] shift and [FIX] (on the [7]).

Another single value operation would be the square root function. Type in
any number, say [1][6][9] then press the [âˆšx] button at the top left.

## Binary Operations

Most arithmetic operations process two values, for instance the addition [+]
which which will add a second value to a first value already entered. For
example typing [3] [ENTER] [2] [+] results in an answer of 5.
